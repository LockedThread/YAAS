# YAAS

Yet Another Automata Simulator (YAAS) is a prototype tool for simulating the execution of Finite Automata, Pushdown Automata and Turing Machines. The current tool features are:

## Finite Automata (FA)

- Full support for Deterministic and Nondeterministic Finite Automata modeling, test and simulation;
- Create, edit, save and save as image;
- Support to add all missing transitions;
- Support for removal of inaccessible and useless states;
- Conversion from Nondeterministic Finite Automaton to Deterministic Finite Automaton;
- Deterministic Finite Automaton minimization;
- Regular Operations:
  - Union;
  - Concatenation;
  - Kleene Star;
  - Complement;
  - Intersection.

## Pushdown Automata (PDA)

- Full support for Deterministic and Nondeterministic Pushdown Automata modeling, test and simulation;
- Create, edit, save and save as image;
- Conversion from Final State to Empty Stack and vice-versa acceptance types.

## Turing Machines (TM)

- Full support for Deterministic Turing Machines modeling, test and simulation;
- Support for Nondeterministic Turing Machines modeling;
- Create, edit, save and save as image;
- Automatic detection of infine loops, i.e., Turing Machines that never halt.
