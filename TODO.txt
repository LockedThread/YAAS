??? Specialized versions of states (Moore machines);
??? Specialized versions of transitions (PDAs, Mealy machines and Turing machines);
??? Zoom-in and zoom-out;

Minimization:
    start distinguishable test using accepting state pairs?
    check if in case of acceptance the accepting state is the same?
