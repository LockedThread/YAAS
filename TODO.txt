****** TAKE CARE OF OBJECTS ID WHEN LOADING FILES!!!!

Regular operations in FA:
    Complement -> needs to generate a new DFA (only performs in DFA)
                  needs to implement the clone operation in FA!
                  null state or new accepting state aligned with initial state (y) and 150 pixels after the last state x
    Concatenation
    Union
    Kleene Star
    Intersection

Remove inacessible states -> new operation? really needs it?
