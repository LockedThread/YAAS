Properties of Finite Automaton (type and formal definition);
Simulation: one string, step by step, string set
Grid / snap to grid for states;
Zoom-in and zoom-out;
Move entire automaton;   <- need to fix new position offset
Drawing panel behavior and scroll pane adjustments.

Specialized versions of states (Moore machines); ???
Specialized versions of transitions (eNFAs, GNFAs, PDAs, Mealy machines and Turing machines); ???
